            <p>
                I currently work at Burgers Smokehouse in the Mailing Department.
                Working with inventory most of the time. I have worked there since October of 2020. 
                I know how to work with computer programs; since Burgers Smokehouse has a program to help keep track of inventory.
                I have experince in Customer Service; from working in a grocccery store for about two years. 
                I choose to learn Software Enginenering it gave me access to learn the basic information about computers and further my self into the languages of computers.
                I feel I still have much to learn about the ends and outs of programming before I can be effectient in it. As I do struggle at times and can improve upon some of the older code.
